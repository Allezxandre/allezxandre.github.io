      <description>I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist that combines high-quality code to sound theory. Through my dual degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I built a solid academic groundwork that my various personal projects enabled me to consolidate.
I am very passionate about everything in the field of Artificial Intelligence that contributes to transforming our lives ethically.
As of today, the field still faces a few technological and theoretical barriers that we will overcome in the future, a future I would like to partake in.</description>
