Through this tracking, the algorithm was able to compute the movement of the shrimp from a video or a camera feed. Environmental research scientists at Université de Lorraine were then to use the software to quantify the water pollution more efficiently, as up to the completion of the project the tracking was done by hand by the research scientists.\nThe implementation used OpenCV for image processing, edge detection and contour detection. The tracking was performed using the Hungarian matching algorithm and a Kalman filter. Through this customized tracking algorithm, the software is able to keep track of each individual shrimp even in complex situations like blurry motion, and crossings with other shrimp.\n","date":1525481308,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525481308,"objectID":"9e7e4aebe2ce0efc1be0c441e87ea30e","permalink":"/project/shrimp-in-petri-dishes/","publishdate":"2018-05-04T19:48:28-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/shrimp-in-petri-dishes/","section":"project","summary":"Using Computer Vision to assess water quality","tags":["machine-learning","computer-vision","opencv","python"],"title":"Shrimp in Petri Dishes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project was done in pairs in the context of a class of Autonomous Robotics.

A server written (from scratch) in Golang takes care of downloading all sorts of files, and through an app on the device, a user can add, pause, and remove downloads. A file still downloading on the server can then be downloaded on or live streamed to the phone. For video files, the server even supports live re-encoding of the files in an iOS-compatible format that follows Apple’s efficient HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.\n    On-the-fly re-encoding of a download by the server   The code makes extensive use of Golang’s concurrency features, which was chosen for this purpose. Communications between the server and the applications use gRPC, Google’s modern take on the RPC protocol that supports HTTP/2 out of the box. The code also re-implements a good deal of Apple’s HLS server tools like the segmenters, the variant playlist creator.
