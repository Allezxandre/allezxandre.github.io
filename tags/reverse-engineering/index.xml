      <title>TikTok Police</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my work on fraud detection at Karos, I was interested to see if I could &lt;strong&gt;identify harassers on TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;, the popular video app.
With TikTok being this popular among teenagers, and with so little control over privacy settings, I felt this was a serious matter TikTok would need to tackle at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is still a work in progress, but already gave right to many interesting developments that involved many of my skills: the creation of the dataset alone led to the use of many reverse-engineering techniques, from SSL API man-in-the-middling to app reverse-engineering through de-compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently writing a blog post to describe this process of data creation, but below is a screen capture of the complex set-up I came up with to circumvent TikTok&#39;s counter-measures against bots:&lt;/p&gt;



  

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;source type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; srcset=&#34;/img/tik-tok-demo/anim.mp4&#34;/&gt;
&lt;source type=&#34;video/webm&#34; srcset=&#34;/img/tik-tok-demo/anim.webm&#34;/&gt;
&lt;source type=&#34;image/gif&#34; srcset=&#34;/img/tik-tok-demo/anim.gif&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/tik-tok-demo/anim.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Sorry, your browser does not seem to support HTML5 animated images.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, I have finished cleaning the data and selecting features. I am now working on creating various models of prediction and will present the results shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stay-tuned&#34;&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>iOS Garage Door Opener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was done in freelance for a French start-up that takes an attempt at popularizing private parking space sharing. The goal was to build an iOS app that connects via Bluetooth-LE to a Raspberry-Pi with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/&#34;&gt;sub-1 GHz transceiver dongle&lt;/a&gt;. Through the Raspberry Pi acting as a Bluetooth-LE interface to the dongle, the iOS App could listen, record, and transmit garage door opener signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry-Pi software implementation was done in Golang, as it allows cross-compilation of a single binary containing all required libraries, and allowed the code to be both portable and optimized. The communication between the iOS device and the Raspberry-Pi was handled using GATT from the Bluetooth-LE protocol. The dongle was later replaced by lower-level transceivers that were operated through the Raspberry-Pi&#39;s GPIO ports.&lt;/p&gt;
