      <description>This project was done in freelance for a French start-up that takes an attempt at popularizing private parking space sharing. The goal was to build an iOS app that connects via Bluetooth-LE to a Raspberry-Pi with a sub-1 GHz transceiver dongle. Through the Raspberry Pi acting as a Bluetooth-LE interface to the dongle, the iOS App could listen, record, and transmit garage door opener signals.
The Raspberry-Pi software implementation was done in Golang, as it allows cross-compilation of a single binary containing all required libraries, and allowed the code to be both portable and optimized.</description>

      <description>A watchface for the Pebble Watch that displays useful informations like weather, now playing music, and upcoming calendar events on your wrist.
The app used a third-party iPhone App to pull data from the phone. I first drafted the design for the watch app. I then developed a logic behind the watch app behavior: it was able to switch screens or change button actions cleverly. I also used the latest features available at the time on the Pebble watch, like permanent storage to make the watch app work even without a connection to the phone.</description>
