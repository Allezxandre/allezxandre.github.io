      <description>This project stemmed from the need of downloading files securely from iOS, an Apple TV or a Mac. A server written (from scratch) in Golang takes care of downloading all sorts of files, and through an app on the device, a user can add, pause, and remove downloads. A file still downloading on the server can then be downloaded on or live streamed to the phone. For video files, the server even supports live re-encoding of the files in an iOS-compatible format that follows Appleâ€™s efficient HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.</description>

      <description>This project was done in freelance for a French start-up that takes an attempt at popularizing private parking space sharing. The goal was to build an iOS app that connects via Bluetooth-LE to a Raspberry-Pi with a sub-1 GHz transceiver dongle. Through the Raspberry Pi acting as a Bluetooth-LE interface to the dongle, the iOS App could listen, record, and transmit garage door opener signals.
The Raspberry-Pi software implementation was done in Golang, as it allows cross-compilation of a single binary containing all required libraries, and allowed the code to be both portable and optimized.</description>
