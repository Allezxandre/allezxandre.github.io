      <description>This project was done in pairs in the context of a class of Autonomous Robotics. We built SLAM-aided task planning software for ROS. The software was written in a mix of C++ and Python and ran on Kinect-enabled Turtlebots. We implemented:
 Object detection from laser data Object collision avoidance Face tracking Infrared-aided auto-docking Landmark recognition Visual localization WiFi signal localization Mapping Occupancy mapping Task planning  At the end of the project, the robot was able to carry-out a list of predefined tasks, namely undocking from its base, scouting around a building, mapping Wi-Fi hotspot locations, coming back to its starting point, and autodocking.</description>
